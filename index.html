    <h1>¡Upside Down and Rightside Up!</h1>
    <h2>By Shaikh "Asghar"</h2>
    <p>The story I decided to share is a somewhat sad feeling that eventually starts to get more upbeat feel. I used some Apple Loops, drums, and some random sound effects that kinda fit the theme I was going for. The sounds I chose for the piece relate to this matter because again it sounded more towards the theme I was actually going for which was more sad in the beginning and slowly gets more upbeat, then a small pause and then REALLY upbeat! The most challenging part for this project in my opinion was actually finding some Apple Loops that fit the sadder part of my composition since I’m more proficient in finding audio and compiling audio that has a more cheerful/upbeat theme since it’s more of my forté. Normally, I prefer making audio with more upbeat sound effects and Apple Loops but again I wanted to challenge myself and try making with a little bit of a depressed feel. In all honesty I feel pretty happy about this composition and thought it came out pretty well considering how much time I had actually spent on it.
